 The Qwt library and included programs are provided under the terms
 of the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (LGPL) with the following
 exceptions:
 1. Widgets that are subclassed from Qwt widgets do not
    constitute a derivative work.
 2. Static linking of applications and widgets to the
    Qwt library does not constitute a derivative work
    and does not require the author to provide source
    code for the application or widget, use the shared
    Qwt libraries, or link their applications or
    widgets against a user-supplied version of Qwt.
      If you link the application or widget to a modified
    version of Qwt, then the changes to Qwt must be
    provided under the terms of the LGPL in sections
    1, 2, and 4.
 3. You do not have to provide a copy of the Qwt license
    with programs that are linked to the Qwt library, nor
    do you have to identify the Qwt license in your
    program or documentation as required by section 6
    of the LGPL.
      However, programs must still identify their use of Qwt.
    The following example statement can be included in user
    documentation to satisfy this requirement:
        [program/widget] is based in part on the work of
        the Qwt project (http://qwt.sf.net).
